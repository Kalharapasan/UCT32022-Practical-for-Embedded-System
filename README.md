- **Day03-Task03** - Advanced Day 3 exercises
- **Day04-Task02** - Keypad interfacing and input handling
- **Day04-Task03** - Additional Day 4 practical work
- **Day05-Task01** - Sensor integration and data processing
- **Day05-Task02** - Communication protocols
- **Day05-Task03** - Advanced Day 5 exercises
- **Day06-2025.09.29** - Real-time systems and interrupts
- **Day07-Task01** - Project integration
- **Day07-Task02** - Final implementations

### Additional Projects
- **03.Day03-2025.09.15** - Dated lab session work
- **Day 05-(2025.09.23)** - Special session projects
- **Task01** - Standalone task implementation
- **Task01-Day2025.09.19** - Specific date assignment
- **Task01u** - Updated task version

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **PlatformIO** - Development platform for embedded systems
- **Arduino Framework** - Programming framework for microcontrollers
- **Wokwi** - Online electronics simulator for testing
- **C++** - Primary programming language

## üìã Each Project Contains

- `src/main.cpp` - Main source code
- `platformio.ini` - PlatformIO configuration
- `diagram.json` - Circuit diagram configuration
- `wokwi.toml` - Wokwi simulator settings
- `lib/` - Custom libraries (when applicable)
- `include/` - Header files
- `test/` - Test files

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Compatible microcontroller (Arduino Uno, ESP32, etc.)
- Required electronic components for each project

### Running a Project
1. Navigate to the desired project folder
2. Open the project in PlatformIO
3. Connect your microcontroller
4. Build and upload the code:
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

### Using Wokwi Simulator
1. Open the project folder
2. Use the Wokwi extension in VS Code
3. Run the simulation using the provided `diagram.json`
